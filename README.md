### The Story of King Vikramaditya and the Thief
 
This story is based on Thirukkural couplet 560:

> குறிப்பிற்கும் குறிப்புணர்வு இல்லாதான் கேண்மை உறுப்பிற்கும் இன்மை உடைத்து.

> He who has no sense of what is fit to be done or left undone,
> 
> 
> Is destitute of sense in all his members too.

The story goes like this:
 
King Vikramaditya was a wise and just ruler who was loved by his subjects. One night, he disguised himself as a commoner and went out to see the condition of his people. He saw a thief who was trying to break into a house. He decided to follow him and see what he would do.
 
The thief managed to enter the house and searched for valuables. He found a chest full of jewels and gold coins. He was overjoyed and decided to take it with him. However, he realized that the chest was too heavy for him to carry alone. He looked around and saw a sleeping man on a cot. He thought that he could wake him up and ask him to help him carry the chest.
 
He went near the man and whispered in his ear: "Hey, wake up! I have found a treasure here. If you help me carry it out, I will share it with you." The man opened his eyes and saw the thief holding a knife. He was terrified and pretended to be asleep. The thief repeated his offer several times, but the man did not respond.
 
The thief got angry and said: "You are a fool! You are missing a great opportunity to become rich. Don't you have any sense of what is fit to be done or left undone?" He then stabbed the man with his knife and killed him.
 
The man who was killed was none other than King Vikramaditya himself. He had sacrificed his life to protect his people from the thief. The thief realized his mistake too late and was caught by the guards who had followed the king. He was punished for his crime and regretted his lack of sense.
 
### The Story of King Dushyanta and Shakuntala
 
This story is based on Thirukkural couplet 81:

> அறிவினான் ஆகுவ துண்டோ பிறிதியல்லால் போற்றினும் பொய்யா புலவி.

> Though learned, he is ignorant, who does not know
> 
> 
> That love is the chief thing in human life.

The story goes like this:
 
King Dushyanta was a handsome and brave ruler who loved hunting. One day, he went to the forest to hunt some animals. He saw a beautiful deer and chased it with his bow and arrow. The deer ran into an ashram (hermitage) where some sages lived.
 
There, he met Shakuntala, the daughter of a sage and a nymph. She was very beautiful and charming. She had been raised by the sages and had never seen a man before. She was watering some plants when she saw the king. She was instantly attracted to him and felt shy.
 
The king also fell in love with her at first sight. He approached her and asked her who she was and where she lived. She told him that she was the daughter of Sage Vishwamitra and that she lived in the ashram with her foster father, Sage Kanva. The king was impressed by her beauty and innocence. He asked her to marry him.
 
Shakuntala agreed to marry him, but she said that she could not leave the ashram without the permission of her foster father, who had gone to another place for some time. The king said that he would wait for him to return and then take her to his palace. He gave her a ring as a token of his love and asked her to keep it safely.
 
He then left the ashram and returned to his kingdom. He promised to come back soon and take Shakuntala with him. However, he got busy with his royal duties and forgot about her.
 
Meanwhile, Shakuntala was eagerly waiting for him to come back. She was so lost in his thoughts that she neglected her duties in the ashram. One day, a sage named Durvasa came to visit the ashram. He was known for his short temper and curses. He saw Shakuntala sitting alone and daydreaming. He called her to welcome him, but she did not hear him.
 
He got angry and cursed her: "You are so engrossed in your lover that you have no respect for your guests. I curse you that your lover will forget you completely. He will not remember you even if you go to him." He then left the ashram.
 
Shakuntala was shocked and scared by the curse. She begged the sage to forgive her and revoke the curse. He said that he could not do that, but he softened the curse a little. He said that if she showed her lover something that belonged to him, he would remember her again.
 
Shakuntala was relieved by this and thought of the ring that the king had given her. She decided to go to his palace and remind him of their love.
 
She took leave from her foster father, who had returned by then, and set out for the palace with some of her friends. On the way, they had to cross a river. Shakuntala dipped her hand in the water to cool herself. The ring slipped from her finger and fell into the water. A fish swallowed it and swam away.
 
Shakuntala did not notice this and continued her journey. She reached the palace and asked to see the king. The king came out and saw her, but he did not recognize her. He asked her who she was and what she wanted from him.
 
Shakuntala was hurt and angry by his coldness. She told him that she was his wife and that he had married her in the forest. She asked him to look at the ring that he had given her as a proof of their marriage.
 
She searched for the ring in her hand, but she could not find it. She realized that she had lost it in the river. She told the king what had happened, but he did not believe her. He thought that she was lying or mad.
 
He rejected her and asked her to leave his palace. Shakuntala felt humiliated and heartbroken by his words. She cried out loud and cursed him for his cruelty.
 
Suddenly, a voice from heaven spoke: "O King, do not doubt this woman's words. She is indeed your wife and you have married her in the forest. The ring that you gave her has been found by a fisherman who brought it to you yesterday."
 
The king remembered everything then. He felt ashamed and sorry for his behavior towards Shakuntala. He asked for her forgiveness and embraced

her. He asked her to come with him to his palace and live with him happily.
 
Shakuntala forgave him and agreed to go with him. She was glad that he had remembered their love and that the curse had been lifted. They went to his palace and lived happily ever after.
 
### The Story of King Nala and Damayanti
 
This story is based on Thirukkural couplet 80:

> அறிவுடையார் ஆவா துணையிலர் பிறிதியல்லால் போற்றுவார் பொய்யு முடையர்.

> Those who have knowledge, if they have not love as their associate,
> 
> 
> Though they may be esteemed, are like sounding brass.

The story goes like this:
 
King Nala was a noble and generous ruler who was skilled in many arts, especially in chariot driving. He was also very handsome and charming. Many princesses wanted to marry him, but he did not choose any of them.
 
Damayanti was the daughter of King Bhima, who ruled over the Vidarbha kingdom. She was very beautiful and virtuous. She had heard about the fame and glory of King Nala and had fallen in love with him without seeing him.
 
One day, she decided to hold a swayamvara (a ceremony where a princess chooses her husband from among many suitors) and invite King Nala to it. She sent a message to him through a golden swan, who was her friend. The swan flew to King Nala's palace and told him about Damayanti's love for him. He also praised her beauty and qualities and urged him to go to her swayamvara.
 
King Nala was curious and interested by the swan's words. He decided to go to Damayanti's swayamvara and see her for himself. He took his chariot and set out for the Vidarbha kingdom.
 
On the way, he met four gods: Indra, Agni, Varuna, and Yama. They had also heard about Damayanti's beauty and wanted to marry her. They recognized King Nala as their devotee and asked him to do them a favor. They asked him to go to Damayanti's swayamvara as their messenger and tell her that they wanted to marry her.
 
King Nala was shocked and scared by their request. He did not want to betray his own love for Damayanti, but he also did not want to disobey the gods. He agreed to do as they said, but he asked them for a boon in return. He asked them to appear in his form when he reached the swayamvara hall, so that Damayanti would not recognize him.
 
The gods agreed to his boon and blessed him. They then followed him to the Vidarbha kingdom in disguise.
 
Damayanti was eagerly waiting for King Nala to come to her swayamvara. She had seen his picture and had fallen more in love with him. She had made up her mind to choose him as her husband.
 
When King Nala arrived at the swayamvara hall, he saw many kings and princes who had come to win Damayanti's hand. He also saw Damayanti herself, who was sitting on a throne surrounded by her friends. He was stunned by her beauty and grace. He felt a strong attraction towards her.
 
He went near her and bowed to her respectfully. He then delivered the message of the gods and told her that they wanted to marry her. He also told her that they were present in the hall in his form.
 
Damayanti was surprised and confused by his words. She looked around and saw five men who looked exactly like King Nala. She could not tell them apart. She wondered how she could choose her beloved among them.
 
She prayed to the gods for guidance and asked them to reveal their true forms. She said that she had already given her heart to King Nala and that she could not marry anyone else.
 
The gods were pleased by her devotion and honesty. They showed their true forms and blessed her. They told her that King Nala was the one who had a garland around his neck. They then left the hall.
 
Damayanti saw King Nala with a garland around his neck. She recognized him as her beloved and smiled. She took a garland of her own and placed it around his neck. She chose him as her husband and declared her love for him.
 
King Nala was overjoyed by her choice and declaration. He also expressed his love for her and thanked the gods for their grace. He married her with the consent of her father and took her to his palace. They lived happily ever after.
